        We are currently in Alpha phase where the online leaderboard is still a
        work in progress. We are working hard to finish everything in the following
        weeks. Until then you can download Lia, develop your bots and fight them
        against the ones built by Lia team, which we ship with our development
        environment. Once the leaderboard will go live you will be one click
        away from testing your bot against the world!
      </p>

        Note that in this state we extremely appreciate all the feedback we can
        get, so if you find some time please tell us what you think (especially
        things that we can improve!). You can find our contacts on the docs page,
        where you can also get everything you need in order to start creating
        your very first bot.

        Happy coding!
